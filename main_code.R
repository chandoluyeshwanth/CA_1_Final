# Cleaning & Understanding Data------------------------------------------------
# Check the dimensions and structure of the data

# 1.  Date format has Full week, month and year with century structure

# 2.  most of the columns which are in num class needs to be changed

# 3.  for further understanding data cleaning is required

# Check for repeating ids
